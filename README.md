### Take home test read me

The file labelled SQL_scripts.sql has the queries I used to generate the final data models used for the analyis. 

There are 6 tables generated; some are tables that I used to build the final models. I decided to separate out the table generation to maintain tables might be useful for other future analysis. 

They are all already written to my <first initial><last name> schema. Hence the DROP TABLE command at the start of each table. 
  
I have commented logic within the files to explain my working.  

Visualisations were done in Tableau. Graphs/findings/recommendations are in the .pdf file that is shared.
